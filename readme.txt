== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've Installed The Plugin Now What? =

If you don't already have category and/or tags, it's time to add them. For example, add the tag 'Slow Cooker' and tag a few posts as slow cooker for the icon to show up.

= Icons aren't showing up, why? =

Use the Cooking Key admin page under the admin dashboard > settings to see why Cooking Key isn't picking up the associated tags or categories.

= Can I change recipe key icon color? =

Yes! You can use CSS to change the color of your icon. (For example: .cooking-key-icon { color:orange;}  ). Get more info at https://recipekeyplugin.com
